Abstract

As everyone knows, the whole world is suffering from COVID-19 pandemic since the start of 2020. This project aims to analyze the data of confirmed cases in different counties collected in United States and apply the big data concept of time series clustering to establish that is there any relation between location and number of cases. 
Furthermore, it would be interesting to apply different methods of clustering to compare the performance, accuracy and overall insights gain, as each methods have different pros and cons. 
The proposed dataset for this project is linked below, however, if determined that this dataset is not sufficient for the project scope, additional datasets can also be included.
